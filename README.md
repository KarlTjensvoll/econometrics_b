EconB 2020 Week1 ex ante excercises

This repository has the necessary files to do the exercises. At the end of the day, I will upload an ex_post folder.

To get this repository, follow the instructions at https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository.
The short story:

* Click "Code" and copy the "HTTPS" link.
* On your computer open you terminal and navigate to a local folder that you want to place the repo at.
* Use the command `git clone link`, where link is the copied link.

The changes that you make in these files should be safe, as long as you do not initate another `git pull` or `git fetch`. So to make git download the ex_post files for you, you need to first "shield" your local changes. This can be done in the following way:

* Open your terminal and navigate to the folder that you cloned the repo at.
* First, run the command `git stash` to "stash" away your local changes.
* Then run `git pull` to pull the repository again.
* Finaly, run `git stash pop` to bring back your local changes.

You should now have the ex_post files downloaded, and your local changes are unaffected.
